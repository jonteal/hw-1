# <Homework-1-Refactoring>
## Description    
The point of this week's homework assignment was to learn the concept of refactoring in order to reinforce the concepts we learned in our first week of class. The main concepts that were covered were the essentials of HTML as well as beginner-level CSS. This project was built in order to understand clean up the existing code in order to follow better standards and practices in code writing etiquette, including the use of proper semantics, structural ordering, proper functionality, consolidation, and descriptive commenting. The outcome resulted in a cleaner and more efficient code that functioned properly and was easy to read for others who might look at it later.

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
## Features
If your project has a lot of features, list them here.
## How to Contribute
If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
## Tests
Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
